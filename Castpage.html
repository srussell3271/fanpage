                Joseph Gatto,-Joe-,is my favorite cast member. I say that he is my 
                favorite because we have the similar personality.I learned my 
                boldness, risky, and funny traits because of him. He taught me to 
                have fun with anything you do because it's like the meaning of life. 
                Joe also taught me to just go for it, nothing can go wrong if you
                put your mind to it. Give or take life is to live for enjoy what you
                have now because the future holds your valuables. Friendship is Joe
                specialty, to him, his friends mean everything to him including his 
                family.

                Salvatore Vulcano -Sal- is my second favorite cast member. I say 
                this because he has style that makes everything seems better. 
                He can by anything and make it seem as if it's the newest trend
                or an outfit from a GQ Model. He also have this sensitive side
                to him that makes everyone more emotional. Sal has a sense of 
                humor that can bring joy to anyone who is upset.

                James Murray -Murr- reminds me a planning tracker. He always tries
                to create a plan for this task and try to go from there. He always 
                have a joyful attitude and loves to eat chicken noddle soup. He 
                taught me to create a plan and even if you fail you can still try
                again. Eventually, you will succeed.
