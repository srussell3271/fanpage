        <p class="about"> 
            IMPRACTICAL JOKERS is an unscripted, hidden-camera show featuring 
            the members of the comedy troupe the Tenderloins, who perform crazy
            pranks on unsuspecting strangers. Comedians and best friends Brian
            "Q" Quinn, James "Murr" Murray, Joe Gatto, and Sal Vulcano take turns
            performing practical jokes in public places. While the rest of gang
            feeds the designated prankster instructions through a hidden earpiece
            he must successfully complete an awkward stunt as often as possible.
            Hidden cameras let the other guys watch -- and laugh. From trying to
            hug people in a bowling ally to randomly scooping mashed potatoes 
            onto restaurant patrons' plates, each comedian does his best to follow
            instructions without dying of humiliation. The cast member who 
            completes the least number of successful pranks must perform one final,
            embarrassing stunt.

                    This show has nothing too bad for kids. It is highly 
                    addicting and so much fun to watch.

                <li>
                    Impractical Jokers [could] possibly the funniest,
                    most ridiculous show I've seen in years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I never thought I could laugh as hard as I could in life 
                    until I watched Impractical Jokers, I always go back to this 
                    season because many of the classic pranks are here in the beginning.
                    All four of the, Sal, Murr, Joe and Q are terrific showing their
                    definity in their humor persona's in many scenarios. Once you 
                    connect with them you will be hooked watching youtube videos 
                    for hours.
