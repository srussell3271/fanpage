        <p id="meaning">
            Even though, they are actors on television, 
            they impact my life on a different level. They each 
            have their flaws which, they turn it into something
            better. Flaws makes their character because they know
            what they struggle with but, they also jokes bout it 
            and make others laugh. This illistrates that you can
            be different and unique because it is what you do about 
            the flaws is what makes you who you are. It is on the 
            inside that effect the outside and how you treat
            others, <em>That </em> is why the Impractical Jokers
            are my favoite.
